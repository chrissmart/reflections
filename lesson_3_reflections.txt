When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would like to share the file in my local postion with others. 
Secondly, it is more accessible to reach the file through the cloud rather than
carrying a burden device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It goes better to pull changes manually as this avoids uncertain result to the local. 
The uncertain result here means a false link to the branch or unauthorized change to the local.
