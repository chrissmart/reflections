When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would like to share the file in my local postion with others. 
Secondly, it is more accessible to reach the file through the cloud rather than
carrying a burden device.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It goes better to pull changes manually as this avoids uncertain result to the local. 
The uncertain result here means a false link to the branch or unauthorized change to the local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used when copying a file from another into yours on GitHub.
To receive a repository either from GitHub or the local into your appointed file, clones play its function.
Branches only happen inside a repository with an eye to creating an additional and independent text or expansion.
