What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A file with the filename extension called .git is built, and
this does favor of keeping a record of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is where the programmer decides how many files transit to the repository.
It provides a more flexible interface for users to package a certain pattern of files in each logic change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By typing git diff --staged
